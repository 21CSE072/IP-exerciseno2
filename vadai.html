Vadai is a South Indian savoury snack made from soaked or fermented pulses moulded into balls or a doughnut shape and then deep fried. c
The resulting snack is soft on the inside and crispy on the outside<br>
Vadai can be made from different types of pulses such as chana dhal (split chickpeas),<br>
toor dhal (yellow pigeon peas) and urad dhal (black gram). The pulses are first washed and soaked in water for around four hours or allowed to ferment overnight.<br> 
The softened or fermented pulses are then pounded into a fine paste. Spicy and savoury ingredients such as onions, green chillies, cumin seeds, curry leaves and salt are later added to the mixture.4 At times, a prawn is also added to the batter.<br>
Traditionally, the batter is placed on a banana leaf, which acts like a mould for shaping it into a ball. Alternatively, it is given a doughnut shape.<br>
The batter is then deep fried in oil until it turns brown.<br>
Singaporeans eat vadai with green chilli, a practice that probably evolved from the local Chinese community.<br> 
However, in India, this is a rare practice, as the Indian variety of green chilli is too spicy to be eaten whole.<br>
In Singapore, the doughnut-shaped version is also usually eaten with coconut chutney.<br>
Among the Hindu community, vadai is not only an everyday snack but also used as a food offering to the gods and eaten during important festivals such as Deepavali.<br>

Dahi vadai, also known as curd vadai, is a version that is served in dahi (plain yoghurt) and popular for its cooling effect.<br>
 
Green chillies, cumin and mustard seeds are often added to the yoghurt for extra flavour.<br>

Masala vadai is made from a blend of various lentils and has added ingredients such as chopped spinach, shredded cabbage or marinated shrimp.<br>

Sambar vadai is a version that is popular in New Delhi, India. <br>

It features vadai that is served in a hot sambar (Indian vegetable stew) with coconut chutney as an accompaniment.<br>

In Singapore, two varieties of vadai are commonly sold. <br>

One is made from soaked lentils that have been pressed into a ball shape and then deep fried. <br>

The other version is made from a batter of fermented lentils that is moulded into a doughnut shape before deep frying.<br>

There are also various versions of vadai that have been created using Chinese-influenced ingredients such as ginger, coriander leaves and seafood stock.<br>
