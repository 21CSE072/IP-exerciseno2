Idli or idly (/ɪdliː/ (listen)) is a type of savoury rice cake,<br>
originating from the South India, popular as a breakfast food in Southern India and in Sri Lanka.<br>
The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and rice.<br>
The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolised by the body.<br>
Idli has several variations, including rava idli, which is made from semolina. Regional variants include sanna of Konkan.<br>
