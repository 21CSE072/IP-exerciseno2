Chapati is a form of Indian flat bread that is common across the continent where it is also referred to as chapathi or chapatti. <br>
Variations are also found across Africa and in China. A chapati is a form of roti — or bread — and it is often referred to as such. <br>
Chapatis in particular, however, differ from other flat breads encompassed by the term roti in that they must only be made from whole wheat  <br>
Similar breads to chapatis exist in the form of roti variations.  <br>
Some variations include missi roti, where two or more flour types are combined to form the dough, and bajira roti, which uses pearl millet in lieu of flour. <br> 
The oven-baked tandoori roti is identical to a chapati with the exception of the cooking method. <br>

Wheat chapatis contain a good amount of dietary fibre that is extremely beneficial if you’re always constipated or have problems emptying your bowels.<br>

IBS patients are suggested to eat wheat chapatis every day when they have constipation as the fibre content in chapatis can help the stool pass easily.<br>

Consuming chapatis every day can help you improve your overall digestion and reduce acidity too.<br>

Rich in Iron<br>
Anaemia is a common problem these days and doctors keep prescribing iron medicines to treat it.<br>

But what if I told you that you can get your daily iron requirement fulfilled from your meals? Studies explain that eating wheat chapatis are rich in iron.<br>

You can also add some fenugreek leaves, spinach paste to your wheat chapati dough to make it richer in iron. Try out various iron-rich wheat chapati recipes.<br>

Rich in Protein<br>
Wheat chapatis or whole wheat chapatis contain a decent quantity of protein. Consuming 4 chapatis can give you 12% of your daily protein intake.<br>

You may add curd, paneer or some protein-rich gravy to the wheat dough to increase the protein amount.<br>

Wheat chapatis can be healthier than rice as they have good amounts of protein as well as healthy carbs.<br>
