Pani Literally translates to water and here the Puris are fried puffed crisp dough balls which are hollow. <br>

Generally, the water or pani is sour, tangy as well as spicy. This spicy pani is balanced with the addition of sweet tamarind chutney.<br>

This sweet chutney is called as Meetha (which means sweet) Pani. <br>

The spicy water is called as Teekha (which means spicy) Pani. Both are added in the puri along with the main filling which consists of boiled potatoes,<br>

 cooked chickpeas, moong sprouts or a thick dry curry made from white peas which is called as Ragda.<br>

Panipuri consists of a round hollow puri (a deep-fried crisp flatbread), filled with a mixture of flavored water (known as imli pani), tamarind chutney, chili powder, chaat masala, potato mash, onion, or chickpeas.<br>

Fuchka (or fuska or puska) differs from panipuri in content and taste. It uses spiced mashed potatoes as the filling. It is tangy rather than sweetish while the water is sour and spicy.<br>
